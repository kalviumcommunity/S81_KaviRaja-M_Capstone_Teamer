Delete all code and files related to:
- Meetings (Meeting model, controller, routes, frontend components)
- VideoCall (all frontend and backend logic)

Then, re-implement a simple meeting feature:
- Meeting creation form (participants, date, time, duration, description)
- After creation, a small meeting div (like poll) appears in the chat UI for all invited users, in real time, without refresh.
